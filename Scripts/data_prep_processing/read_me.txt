Scripts for 2018 paired eDNA/Beach Seine data
Note: all scripts must be run independantly (i.e., restart to clear environment and packages loaded)

01_data_cleaning:
		- formatting colnames
		- pool PCR replicates
		- remove samples not used in this analyses
		- Check that within site dissimilarity is <0.49 (it checks out - 
		none >0.49) (Kelly 2018)
		- identify minimum sequence depth  (23988) - had to drop one 
		BS paired site: GOG1, sept 2019
			-  discarded sites/samples that aren't used in analyses
		- rarify reads (don't use McKnight et al 2018, reasons why) before 1726 ASVs, 
		24629880 reads; after 954 ASVs 3310344
		- create site-level data from sample data - because it is all duplicated

	for a set of ASVs ranging in their number of positive detections (2 - 243) in entire detection histories
	IN:		detection histories - ASVlist.rds
	OUT:	plots of probability of occupancy for differing numbers of detections	

03_BS_taxized:
	resolve taxonomy for beach seining species names
	IN:		Hakai fish taxa and codes - fishcodes.csv
	OUT:	Taxonomy resolved - taxa_BS_resolved.rds

04_eDNA_taxa_assignment:
	NOTE: this will now replace assignment_corrections04.R and eDNA_taxized05b_new.R
	- use the top 10 NCBI hits to determine taxa clusters that are indestinguishable at 12S mifish
	Steps:1. Identifies if taxa are native to the Northeastern Pacific
			a. this is done manually at the moment because we are also detecting freshwater 
			species from rivers and estuaries. If we compile a list of probably species, this
			could be replaced. Probably have to be updated every time because of novel results.
		2. Identifies all ASVs and taxa with multiple equal top hits
           		a. If this can be resolved by removing non-natives (from step 1), it is.
           		b. If not, taxa are grouped, within family or genus - note: groups are assigned within a taxonomic level, not across that level, allowing for other distinct species or sub groups within that level to maintain their unique identity
		3. Identifies ASVs and taxa assigned to a single species
           		a. If a species is non-native, the next closest native species is assigned (only within genus) - this only happened on one occasion - I think that if the problem was more prevalent another approach might be needed
           		b. All  taxa that were assigned to groups in Step 2 are assigned to those groups.

05_bs_data_formatting:

	-Using bayesian estimates of mass:length ratios from higher taxonomy, Froese, R., J. Thorson and R.B. Reyes Jr., 2014. A Bayesian approach for estimating length-weight relationships in fishes. J. Appl. Ichthyol. 30(1):78-85.
	-In the field a subsample of fish were measured when >20 were identified.  In these cases, the weight 
	distribution was sampled with replacement equal to the number of observations of that species. This was repeated 1000
	times and the mean and SD taken. Occaisionally, fish could not be measured, but were only counted. In these cases,
	samples were drawn from the global survey-wide distribution for that species.
	Taxa are measured at sites by abundance, weight (grams), as well as abundance/m^2 (seafloor area), abundance/m^3 (seawater volume), weight/m^2 (seafloor area), and weight/m^3 (seawater volume)
